  What is Flexbox? 
  Flexbox
  Flexbox is a set of related CSS properties for building 1-dimensional layouts.
  The main idea behind flexbox is that empty space inside a container element can be automatically divided by its child elements.
  Flexbox makes it easy to automatically align items to one another inside a parent container, both horizontally and vertically.
  Flexbox solves common problems such as vertical centering and creating equal-height columns.
  Flexbox is perfect for replacing floats, allowing us to write fewer and cleaner HTML and CSS code.

<!-- Flexbox Terminology
  display: flex
  The element on which we want to use flexbox is called the flex container. 
  All we have to do in order to create a flex container is to set its display property to flex.
  If we do this, then all of the direct children of that flex container become flex items.
  The direction in which these items are laid out is called the main axis.
  Then the other perpendicular axis is called the cross axis.
